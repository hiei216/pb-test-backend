# pb-test-backend

**Starting the service**: 

Do <strong>npm install</strong> and run the service with <strong>npm run start</strong>.

Before you start the backend you also need to have a running local mondodb database on <strong>localhost:27017</strong>.

The .env with global variables is exceptionally added to the repo just for testing purpose.

After each start the service should add 10 more entries to the examples collection in the database.
